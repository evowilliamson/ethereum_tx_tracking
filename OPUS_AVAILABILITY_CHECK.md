# How to Verify Opus Availability in Cursor

## Quick Check Methods

### Method 1: Check Model Selection in Cursor
1. Open Cursor Settings (Cmd/Ctrl + ,)
2. Navigate to "Features" → "AI" or "Model Settings"
3. Look for model options - if "Claude Opus" or "Opus" appears in the dropdown, it's available
4. Check your subscription/plan status - Opus may require a specific tier

### Method 2: Test with a Simple Request
Try asking Opus to perform a simple task:
- Ask it to write a Python function
- Request code analysis
- Ask a complex reasoning question

If Opus responds, it's working!

### Method 3: Check Cursor Status/Updates
1. Check Cursor's status page or announcements
2. Look for any deprecation notices about Opus
3. Check recent Cursor updates/changelog

### Method 4: Verify Current Model
- Look at the model indicator in Cursor's chat interface
- Check which model is currently active
- Try switching models if available

## Current Status

**You are currently using: Composer**

Composer is Cursor's AI coding assistant. If you're seeing this response, you're using Composer, not Opus.

## What to Do If Opus Isn't Available

1. **Check Your Plan**: Opus may require a specific subscription tier
2. **Update Cursor**: Ensure you're on the latest version
3. **Contact Support**: If Opus should be available but isn't, contact Cursor support
4. **Use Composer**: Composer (current model) provides similar capabilities for coding tasks

## Testing Opus Availability

To test if Opus is available, try:
- Opening a new chat in Cursor
- Checking the model selector dropdown
- Attempting to switch to Opus if it appears as an option
